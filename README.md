#### Like and share photos generated by the NASA API. Check it out [here](https://solaroid.jamiekaram.dev)

## Features

- Infinate Scrolling
- Like photos are saved even on refresh
- Sharable links
- Fully styled by myself useing tailwind CSS with a little help from Headless UI.

## Lessons Learned

On this project I wanted to challenge myself with an inifiate scrolling feature. I started by learning the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) which is placed at the bottom of the photos list and once seen fetches the next 7 days. . Useing React Query to set markers to load the next 7 images once the user scolls to the bottom of the page.
